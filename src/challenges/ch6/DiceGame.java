/*
- Write a program that uses the Die class that was presented in this chapter to play a simple dice game between the computer and the user 

- The program should create 2 instances of the Die class (each a 6-sided die) 

- One Die object is the computer�s die and the other Die object is the user�s die

- The program should have a loop that iterates 10 times 

- Each time the loop iterates, it should roll both dice 

- The die with the highest value wins (In case of a tie, there is no winner for that particular roll of the dice)

- As the loop iterates, the program should keep count of the number of times the computer wins and the number of times that the user wins 

- After the loop performs all of its iterations, the program should display who was the grand winner, the computer or the user
