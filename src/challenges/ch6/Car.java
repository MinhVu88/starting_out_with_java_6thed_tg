/*
- Write a class named Car that has the following fields:

� yearModel: The yearModel field is an int that holds the car�s year model

� make: The make field references a String object that holds the make of the car

� speed: The speed field is an int that holds the car�s current speed

- In addition, the class should have the following constructor & other methods:

� Constructor: The constructor should accept the car�s year model & make as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object�s yearModel & make fields. The
constructor should also assign 0 to the speed field

� Accessors: Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an object�s yearModel, make & speed fields

� accelerate: The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each time it is called

� brake: The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it is called

- Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object & then calls the accelerate method 5 times 

- After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car & display it 

- Then call the brake method 5 times 

- After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car & display it
