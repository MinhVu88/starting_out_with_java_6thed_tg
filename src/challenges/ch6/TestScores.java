/*
- Design a TestScores class that has fields to hold 3 test scores 

- The class should have a constructor, accessor and mutator methods for the test score fields and a method that returns the average of the test scores 

- Demonstrate the class by writing a separate program that creates an instance of the class 

- The program should ask the user to enter 3 test scores, which are stored in the TestScores object 

- Then the program should display the average of the scores, as reported by the TestScores object
