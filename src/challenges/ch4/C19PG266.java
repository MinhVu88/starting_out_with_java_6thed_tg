/*
- Write a program that tests your ESP (extrasensory perception) 

- The program should randomly select the name of a color from the following list of words: Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow

- To select a word, the program can generate a random number 

- For example, if the number is 0, the selected word is Red, if the number is 1, the selected word is Green and so forth

- Next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that the computer has selected

- After the user has entered his or her guess, the program should display the name of the randomly selected color 

- The program should repeat this 10 times and then display the number of times the user correctly guessed the selected color
