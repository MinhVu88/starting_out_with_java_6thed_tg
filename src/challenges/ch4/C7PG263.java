/* 
- A hotelï¿½s occupancy rate = Number of rooms occupied / Total number of rooms

- Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for each floor of a hotel 

- The program should start by asking for the number of floors in the hotel 

- A loop should then iterate once for each floor 

- During each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms on the floor & the number of them that are occupied 

- After all the iterations, the program should display the number of rooms the hotel has, the number of them that are occupied, the number that are vacant & the occupancy rate for the hotel

- Input Validation: 

	+ Do not accept a value less than 1 for the number of floors 

	+ Do not accept a number less than 10 for the number of rooms on a floor
