/*
- In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy 

- The following formula can be used to determine a moving object�s kinetic energy: KE = � mv^2

+ KE: the kinetic energy 

+ m: the object�s mass in kilograms 

+ v: the object�s velocity in meters per second

- Write a method named kineticEnergy that accepts an object�s mass (in kilograms) & velocity (in meters per second) as arguments 

- The method should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has 

- Demonstrate the method by calling it in a program that asks the user to enter values for mass & velocity
