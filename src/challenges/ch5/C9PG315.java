/*
- The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: Distance = Speed * Time

- Write a method named distance that accepts a vehicleï¿½s speed & time as arguments & returns the distance the vehicle has traveled.

- For example, if a train travels 40 miles-per-hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles
 
- and it should display a report similar to the one that follows:

Hour		Distance Traveled
------------------------------
1				40
2				80
3				120

- Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed & do not accept any value less than 1 for time traveled (negative number is not allowed in this program)

- Modify pc2pg263.java to use the method
