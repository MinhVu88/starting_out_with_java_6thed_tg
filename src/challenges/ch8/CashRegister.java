/*
- Write a CashRegister class that can be used with the RetailItem class that you wrote in Chapter 6�s Programming Challenge 4 (RetailItem.java) 

- The CashRegister class should simulate the sale of a retail item 

- It should have a constructor that accepts a RetailItem object as an argument

- The constructor should also accept an integer that represents the quantity of items being purchased 

- In addition, the class should have the following methods:

� The getSubtotal method should return the subtotal of the sale = the quantity * by the price 

	+ This method must get the price from the RetailItem object that was passed as an argument to the constructor

� The getTax method should return the amount of sales tax on the purchase 

	+ The sales tax rate is 6% of a retail sale

� The getTotal method should return the total of the sale = the subtotal + the sales tax

- Demonstrate the class in a program that asks the user for the quantity of items being purchased and then displays the sale�s subtotal, amount of sales tax and total
