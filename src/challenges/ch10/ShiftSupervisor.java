/*
- In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift 

- In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals 

- Design a ShiftSupervisor class that extends the Employee class 

- The ShiftSupervisor class should have a field that holds the annual salary and 
	a field that holds the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned 

- Write 1 or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class 

- Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a ShiftSupervisor object
