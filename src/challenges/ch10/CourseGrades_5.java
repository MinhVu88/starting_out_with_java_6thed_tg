/*
- In a course, a teacher gives the following tests & assignments:

	� A lab activity that is observed by the teacher & assigned a numeric score

	� A pass/fail exam that has 10 questions & the minimum passing score is 70

	� An essay that is assigned a numeric score

	� A final exam that has 50 questions

- Write a class named CourseGrades, which should have a GradedActivity array named grades as a field 

- The array should have 4 elements, one for each of the assignments previously described 

- The class should have the following methods:

* setLab: This method should accept a GradedActivity object as its argument

	+ This object should already hold the student�s score for the lab activity 
	
	+ Element 0 of the grades field should reference this object

* setPassFailExam: This method should accept a PassFailExam object as its argument

	+ This object should already hold the student�s score for the pass/fail exam 
	
	+ Element 1 of the grades field should reference this object

* setEssay: This method should accept an Essay object as its argument (use the Essay class or a GradedActivity object) 

	+ This object should already hold the student�s score for the essay 
	
	+ Element 2 of the grades field should reference this object

* setFinalExam: This method should accept a FinalExam object as its argument

	+ This object should already hold the student�s score for the final exam 
	
	+ Element 3 of the grades field should reference this object

* toString: This method should return a string that contains the numeric scores & grades for each element in the grades array

- Demonstrate the class in a program
