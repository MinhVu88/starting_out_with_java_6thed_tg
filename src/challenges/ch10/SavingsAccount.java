/*
- Design a SavingsAccount class that extends the BankAccount class. 

- The SavingsAccount class should have a status field to represent an active or inactive account. 

- If the balance of a savings account falls below $25, it becomes inactive (The status field could be a boolean variable) 

- No more withdrawals may be made until the balance is raised above $25, at which time the account becomes active again. 

- The savings account class should have the following methods:

* withdraw: A method that determines whether the account is inactive before a withdrawal is made (No withdrawal will be allowed if the account is not active) 
			A withdrawal is then made by calling the superclass version of the method.

* deposit: A method that determines whether the account is inactive before a deposit is made. 
			If the account is inactive & the deposit brings the balance above $25, the account becomes active again. 
			A deposit is then made by calling the superclass version of the method.

* monthlyProcess: Before the superclass method is called, this method checks the number of withdrawals. 
					If the number of withdrawals for the month is more than 4, a service charge of $1 for each withdrawal above 4 is 
					added to the superclass field that holds the monthly service charges.
					(Don�t forget to check the account balance after the service charge is taken. If the balance falls below $25, the account becomes inactive)

- In your demo program, create a SavingsAccount object by making up a starting balance & interest rate, write a loop that iterates 5 times & 
	generate a random deposit & withdrawal (values 1 - 100) in each iteration on the account using your methods. 

- Print out the status of the account (balance, charges, number of transactions) after each transaction
