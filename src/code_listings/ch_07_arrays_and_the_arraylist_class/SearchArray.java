/* 
- This program applies the sequential search algorithm to search arrays for specific items 

- this algorithm uses a loop to sequentially step through an array, starting with the 1st element

- It compares each element with the value being searched for and stops when the value is found or the end of the array is encountered

- If the value being searched for is not in the array, the algorithm unsuccessfully searches to the end of the array

- If the value is found, its array index is returned

- Otherwise, -1 (invalid index) is returned, indicating the value did not appear in the array
