/* 
 * an aggregate class/object contains references to objects from other classes & has ownership of those classes
 * the Course class is an aggregate class & instances of this class are aggregate objects
 * 
 * private fields such as instructor & textbook in an aggregate class are called field objects
 * a field object is a variable that references objects of a particular class & holds memory addresses of those instances
 * 
 * the relationship between the Course, Instructor & TextBook classes is considered a "has-a" & "whole-part" relationship
 * in this context, the Course class & its instances own/contain the Instructor & TextBook classes/instances
 * for example, a math course has a math teacher & math textbooks => the teacher & textbooks are parts that make up the course
 * without a math course, there wouldn't be any math teacher or math textbooks
 * 
 * when the Course class & its instances want to modify something about the Instructor or TextBook classes/instances
 * copies of the Instructor or TextBook instances will be created to receive changes (thru the creation of a copy constructor in each of the classes)
 * the copies could be seen as a layer between the Course class & the other 2 classes (Instructor & TextBook)
 * this layer has 2 main functions: 1st, it reflects modifications made to the copies & 2nd, it protects the source data in those 2 classes
 * with this approach, the source data will remain intact & secure
 * otherwise, security holes/issues may arise for those 2 classes
 * 
 * a reference copy creates a copy of a reference variable that holds the memory address of a class's instance
 * an object copy creates a copy of the object itself
 * 
 * when a copy of an aggregate object is created, copies of instances that it references must also be made => a deep copy
 * when a copy of an aggregate object is created but only reference copies of instances that it references are made => a shallow copy (security holes)
 * 
 * when a method in an aggregate class is called, it should return a reference to a copy of a field object to the method call, not the field object itself
 * otherwise, security issues may arise
