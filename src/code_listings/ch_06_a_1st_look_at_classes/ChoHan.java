/*
- Cho-Han is a traditional Japanese gambling game in which a dealer uses a cup to roll 2 six-sided dice 

- The cup is placed upside down on a table so that the value of the dice is concealed 

- Players then wager on whether the sum of the dice values is even (Cho) or odd (Han) 

- The winner or winners take all of the wagers or the house takes them if there are no winners

- We will develop a program that simulates a simplified variation of the game 

- The simulated game will have a dealer and 2 players 

- The players will not wager money but will simply guess whether the sum of the dice values is even (Cho) or odd (Han) 

- 1 point will be awarded to the player or players correctly guessing the outcome 

- The game will play for 5 rounds and the player with the most points is the grand winner

- In the program, we will use the Die class (Die.java) 

- We will create 2 instances of the class to represent 2 six-sided dice 

- In addition to the Die class, we will write the following classes:

� Dealer class: We will create an instance of this class to represent the dealer 

	+ It will have the ability to roll the dice, report the value of the dice and report whether the total dice value is Cho or Han

� Player class: We will create 2 instances of this class to represent the players

	+ Instances of the Player class can store the player�s name, make a guess between Cho and Han and be awarded points
*/

/*
- the class's functions:

	+ generate 5 rounds of the game
	
	+ check players' guesses against dealer's results

	+ display the results between players & dealer of each round

	+ display the final winner between the 2 players

- classes to be used: Dealer.java, Player.java
