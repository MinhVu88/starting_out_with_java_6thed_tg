/*
- In Java, there are 2 categories of exceptions: unchecked & checked 

- Unchecked exceptions are those that inherit from the Error class or the RuntimeException class

- You should NOT handle unchecked exceptions

- Those that do not inherit from Error or RuntimeException are checked exceptions 

- These are the exceptions that you SHOULD handle in your program 

- If the code in a method can potentially throw a checked exception, then that method must meet 1 of the following requirements:

	� It must handle the exception

	� It must have a throws clause listed in the method header (If there is more than 1 exception type, separate them with commas)
	
- The throws clause informs the compiler of the exceptions that could get thrown from a method
*/

/*
- use the throw statement to throw an exception manually 

- The general format of the throw statement:	throw new ExceptionType(MessageString);

	+ ExceptionType: an exception class name
	
	+ MessageString: an optional String argument passed to the exception object�s constructor

- The throw statement causes an exception object to be created and thrown 

- The MessageString argument contains a custom error message that can be retrieved from the exception object�s getMessage method 

- If you do not pass a message to the constructor, the exception will have a null message
*/

/*
- Note: Don�t confuse the throw statement with the throws clause 

- The throw statement causes an exception to be thrown 

- The throws clause informs the compiler that a method throws one or more exceptions
