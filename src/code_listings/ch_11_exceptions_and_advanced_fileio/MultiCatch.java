// This program demonstrates how multiple exceptions can be caught with a single catch clause

/*
- Beginning with Java 7, a catch clause can handle more than 1 type of exception

- This can reduce a lot of duplicated code in a try statement that needs to catch multiple exceptions but perform the same operation for each one
