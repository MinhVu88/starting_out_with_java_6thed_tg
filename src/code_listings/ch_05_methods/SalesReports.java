/* description:

- This program reads 30 days of sales amounts from a file & then displays the total sales & average daily sales 

Here�s a brief pseudocode model of the algorithm:

- Ask the user to enter the name of the file

- Get the total of the sales amounts in the file

- Calculate the average daily sales

- Display the total & average daily sales

Instead of writing the entire program in the main method, the algorithm was broken down into the following methods:

� getFileName�This method displays an input dialog box asking the user to enter the name of the file containing 30 days of sales amounts 

The method returns a reference to a String object containing the name entered by the user

� getTotalSales�This method accepts the name of a file as an argument 

The file is opened, the sales amounts are read from it & the total of the sales amounts is accumulated

The method returns the total as a double

� displayResults�This method accepts as arguments the total sales & the average daily sales 

It displays a message dialog box indicating these values
