/* description:

- Methods can also be called in a hierarchical or layered fashion 
- In other words, method A can call method B, which can then call method C 
- When method C finishes, the JVM returns to method B 
- When method B finishes, the JVM returns to method A 
- This program demonstrates this with 3 methods: main, deep & deeper 
- The main method calls the deep method, which then calls the deeper method
