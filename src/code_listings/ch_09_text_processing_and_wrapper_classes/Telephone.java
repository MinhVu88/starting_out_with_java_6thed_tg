/*
Telephone numbers in the United States are commonly formatted to appear in the following manner:		(XXX)XXX-XXXX

In the format, X represents a digit 

The 3 digits that appear inside the parentheses are the area code 

The 3 digits following the area code are the prefix & the 4 digits after the hyphen are the line number 

Here is an example:		(919)555-1212

Although the parentheses & the hyphen make the number easier for people to read, those characters are unnecessary for processing by a computer 

In a computer system, a telephone number is commonly stored as an unformatted series of digits, as shown here:	9195551212

A program that works with telephone numbers usually needs to unformat numbers that have been entered by the user 

This means that the parentheses & the hyphen must be removed before the number is stored in a file or processed in some other way

In addition, such a program needs the ability to format the digits so that the number contains the parentheses & the hyphen when it appears on the screen or is printed on paper


the following static methods:

� isFormatted: This method accepts a String argument & returns true if the argument is formatted as (XXX)XXX-XXXX 

	If the argument is not formatted this way, the method returns false

� unformat: This method accepts a String argument 

	If the argument is formatted as (XXX)XXX-XXXX, the method returns an unformatted version of the argument with the parentheses & the hyphen removed 

	Otherwise, the method returns the original argument

� format: This method�s purpose is to format a sequence of digits as (XXX)XXX-XXXX

	The sequence of digits is passed as a String argument 

	If the argument is 10 characters in length, then the method returns the argument with parentheses & a hyphen inserted 

	Otherwise, the method returns the original argument
