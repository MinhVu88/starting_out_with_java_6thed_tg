/* reminder:   

- Make sure that a file exists before you try to open it for input/reading data from it 
- If you attempt to open a file for input & the file does not exist, the program will throw an exception & halt
*/

/* description: 

- after you create a File object representing the file that you want to open, you can use the File class�s exists method to determine whether the file exists 
- the method returns true if the file exists or false if the file does not exist
- this program is a modification of FileSum.java, which checks for the existence of a file called numbers.txt before the program attempts to open it
