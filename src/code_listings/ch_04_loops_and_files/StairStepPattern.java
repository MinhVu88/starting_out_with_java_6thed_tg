/* description:  

- suppose you want to display the following stair-step pattern that has 6 rows & 6 columns:

# 	1st row
- # 	2nd row
- - # 		3rd row
- - - # 		4th row
- - - - # 			5th row
- - - - - # 			6th row
1 2 3 4 5 6 (column)

$ 	1st row
- $ 	2nd row
- - $ 		3rd row
- - - $ 		4th row
- - - - $ 			5th row
- - - - - $ 			6th row
1 2 3 4 5 6 (column)
          
- In general, we can describe each column as having some number of hyphens under a # character 

- Hereï¿½s a column-by-column description:
	+ 1st column: 5 hyphens under 1 # 
	+ 2nd column: 4 hyphens under 1 # 
	+ 3rd column: 3 hyphens under 1 # 
	+ 4th column: 2 hyphens under 1 # 
	+ 5th column: 1 hyphen under 1 # 
	+ 6th column: 0 hyphen under 1 #

- In general, we can describe each row as having some number of spaces followed by a $ character

- Here's a row-by-row description:
 	+ 1st row: 0 hyphen followed by 1 $
 	+ 2nd row: 1 hyphen followed by 1 $
 	+ 3rd row: 2 hyphens followed by 1 $
 	+ 4th row: 3 hyphens followed by 1 $
 	+ 5th row: 4 hyphens followed by 1 $
 	+ 6th row: 5 hyphens followed by 1 $

- input: number of #/$, number of hyphens, number of columns/rows
- process: write code that contains a pair of nested loops that perform:
	+ the outer loop (wheel 1) will iterate 6 times, each time:
		* the inner loop (wheel 2) prints the correct number of hyphens, side by side
		* then prints a #/$ character
- output: the stair-step pattern of the sharp/money characters
