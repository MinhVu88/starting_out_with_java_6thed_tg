/* description:

- FileSum2.java shows you how to make sure that a file exists before trying to open it for input/reading data from it 

- But when you are opening a file for output/writing data to it, sometimes you want to make sure the file doesn't exist 

- When you use a PrintWriter object to open a file, the file will be erased if it already exists 

- If you don't want to erase the existing file, you have to check for its existence before creating the PrintWriter object 

- This program shows you how to use the File classï¿½s exists method in this type of situation 

- This is a modification of FileWriteDemo.java
