/* description:

- This program writes the names of your friends to a file 
- It asks the user to enter the number of his/her friends as well as the file name
*/

/* ipo:

- input: the name of the file, the names of your friends, the number of friends
- process:
	+ get keyboard input for the file name, the names of friends & the number of friends
	+ create instances of the PrintWriter, FileWriter & Scanner classes which use certain methods such as print or println to write or add data to the file
	+ loop thru the number of friends with each iteration asking for their names
- output: a text file that contains the names of the friends that are written or added to it
*/

/* pseudocode:

- declare String var(s): fileName, friendName
- declare int var(s): numberOfFriends
- create a Scanner class object: kb
- display "enter the file name: "
- keyboard input: fileName
- display "enter the number of friends: "
- keyboard input: numberOfFriends
- create a PrintWriter class object: outputFile_0
- for i = 1 to numberOfFriends:
	+ display "enter the name of friend number ", i, ": "
	+ keyboard input: friendName
	+ file input: friendName
- create a FileWriter class object: newFriend
- create another PrintWriter class object: outputFile_1
- append extra data to the file
- close the file
